### Introduction
- **Background**: Marine microorganisms represent a vast and largely untapped resource for novel enzyme discovery. The extreme conditions of marine environments (high pressure, low temperature, high salinity) have led to the evolution of enzymes with unique properties that are highly valuable for industrial applications. These biocatalysts offer significant advantages including high efficiency, substrate specificity, and reduced environmental impact. However, only a small fraction of marine microorganisms can be cultured in laboratory conditions, and traditional enzyme screening approaches are time-consuming and resource-intensive. Computational approaches for mining novel enzymes from marine metagenomic data provide a promising alternative to accelerate the discovery of industrially valuable biocatalysts.

- **Learning Objectives**:
  - Master metagenomic data analysis techniques
  - Understand enzyme function prediction from sequence information
  - Learn structural homology modeling for enzyme characterization
  - Integrate sequence, structural, and environmental information in enzyme activity prediction

### Problem Statement
- **Technical Description**: Develop computational methods to identify and characterize novel enzymes from marine microbiome metagenomic data, with a focus on predicting enzyme activity and substrate specificity.
- **Mathematical Definition**:
  - **Stage 1: Sequence Analysis and Homology Modeling**
    - Input: S ∈ Σ^n where
      - Σ: amino acid alphabet
      - n: sequence length
    - Outputs: 
      - X ∈ ℝ^d: Protein sequence feature vector
      - M ∈ ℝ^(3×n): 3D structural model
    - Learning Task: Enzyme family classification and structural prediction
    - Example Objective Function: min_θ L_feat = L_class + λL_structure

  - **Stage 2: Enzyme Activity and Specificity Prediction**
    - Input: G = (V, E) where
      - V: nodes representing amino acids with features
      - E: edges representing spatial proximity between amino acids
    - Output: y ∈ ℝ or y ∈ {0,1,...,k}: Activity level or substrate class
    - Learning Task: Graph-based regression or classification
    - Example Objective Function: min_φ L_pred = L_MSE(y, f(G;φ)) or L_CE(y, f(G;φ))
- **Key Challenges**:
  - Handling large and noisy metagenomic datasets
  - Accurate prediction of enzyme function from sequence
  - Limited availability of experimentally validated marine enzymes
  - Integrating environmental context into prediction models
